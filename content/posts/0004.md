TODO: picture of empty living room

Jun is dropping by today to help out and we're going to build the framing for the living room.

I'm planning on building a wall here and two sliding doors, it looks roughly like this.

I drew up some plans in Figma based on the sketch to make it easier to confirm how much material I actually need. One problem is that the current pillars are 100mm x 100mm while 2x4s are 89mm x 38mm. I wanted the new walls to wrap over the pillars, my solution was to lay an additional 1x4 over the 2x4 in a T or L shape. The proper method would probably involve cutting along the lengths of the 2x4s so that the overall thickness matches the pillars.

But I didn't.

I also made a change, instead of laying the 1x4s lengthwise against the 2x4s, I decided to lay them horizontally so the plywood walls I'll install will line up against them.
